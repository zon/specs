# Orchestration Format

The orchestration format defines implementation contracts using idealized code. An orchestration document specifies function names, orchestration structure, and helper vocabulary that the real implementation must preserve. Orchestrations omit anything that would obscure the logic: no error wrapping, no debug code, no retries, no dependency injection boilerplate.

Orchestration functions are implemented as written — same names, same signatures, same orchestration structure.

## Structure

### Writing Orchestrations

Write in the language the feature is implemented in, using an idealized dialect:

- **Pass failures through.** Propagate failures from helpers directly using the language's idiomatic mechanism (returned errors, thrown exceptions, result types). Only introduce a named error value when it represents a distinct domain condition with no underlying cause (e.g. `CartError.Empty` is a state, not a failure).
- **No debug code.** Remove all logger calls, debug statements, and diagnostic output.
- **Use dependency injection for side effects.** Any helper that performs side effects (database writes, network calls, notifications) must be injected rather than called as a static function. The caller wires in real implementations; tests substitute mocks.
- **No infrastructure types.** Use domain nouns, not framework types like request contexts, HTTP writers, etc.
- **Only write bodies that are pure orchestration.** Every line must be a domain condition, a named step call, or a return value. If writing the body would require literals, string construction, or format details, don't write it — just call the function by name.

An orchestration should be short enough to read in one pass — typically under 20 lines. If it grows longer, split it into named sub-orchestrations.

### Writing Tests

Tests cover orchestration decisions only — that the right helpers were called under the right conditions. Every line in a test body should be a domain-language call: setup, invocation, or assertion. If an assertion requires a literal value, a file path, a URL, or any format detail, extract it into a named test helper. Each test covers one domain outcome: given this domain state, calling the orchestration produces this domain result.

# Checkout Orchestration

## Purpose
Process a cart purchase and notify the user.

## Orchestration

**Module:** `checkout`

```typescript
class Checkout {
    constructor(
        private orders: OrdersClient,
        private payments: PaymentsClient,
        private email: EmailClient,
    ) {}

    async checkout(cart: Cart, user: User) {
        if (cart.isEmpty()) return CartError.Empty

        const order = this.orders.create(cart, user)

        if (!await this.payments.charge(order)) {
            this.orders.cancel(order)
            await this.email.sendDeclined(order, user)
            return
        }

        await this.email.sendConfirmation(order, user)
        return order
    }
}
```

### Helpers

- **`orders.create(cart, user)`** — builds an order record from the cart contents and user identity
- **`payments.charge(order)`** — attempts to collect payment for the order; returns whether it succeeded
- **`orders.cancel(order)`** — marks the order as void so it is never fulfilled
- **`email.sendConfirmation(order, user)`** — notifies the user that their purchase was successful
- **`email.sendDeclined(order, user)`** — notifies the user that their payment was not accepted

## Tests

**Module:** `checkout`

```typescript
test("successful checkout", () => {
    const user = users.any()
    const basket = cart.any().withItems(cart.anItem())
    const svc = checkout.withMocks()
    const order = svc.checkout(basket, user)
    expect(order).toMatchOrder(basket, user)
    expect(email.sent()).toContain(email.confirmation(order, user))
})

test("payment declined", () => {
    const user = users.any()
    const basket = cart.any().withItems(cart.anItem())
    const svc = checkout.withMocks({ payments: payments.thatDeclines() })
    svc.checkout(basket, user)
    expect(orders.created()).toBeEmpty()
    expect(email.sent()).toContain(email.declined(user))
})

test("empty cart", () => {
    const svc = checkout.withMocks()
    const result = svc.checkout(cart.empty(), users.any())
    expect(result).toBe(CartError.Empty)
})
```

### Helpers

- **`checkout.withMocks(overrides?)`** — constructs a `Checkout` with default mock implementations; pass overrides to substitute specific clients
- **`users.any()`** — returns a valid user in a default state suitable for checkout
- **`cart.any()`** — returns a cart builder; call `.withItems(...)` to populate it
- **`cart.anItem()`** — returns a purchasable item with a non-zero price
- **`cart.empty()`** — returns a cart with no items
- **`payments.thatDeclines()`** — returns a payments mock whose next charge attempt fails
- **`orders.created()`** — returns the list of orders persisted during the test
- **`email.sent()`** — returns the list of emails sent during the test
- **`email.confirmation(order, user)`** — constructs the expected confirmation email value for assertion
- **`email.declined(user)`** — constructs the expected declined-payment email value for assertion

## Module Structure

The orchestration function lives in an [orchestration module](glossary.md#orchestration-module). Each helper lives in an [implementation module](glossary.md#implementation-module).

Every orchestration document must declare its module assignments. The `**Module:**` line under `## Orchestration` names the orchestration module; the `**Module:**` line under `## Tests` names the test module. These are implementation contracts — the code must match.

Tests live in or beside the module they test, using whatever convention the implementation language idiomatically uses (e.g. Go's `_test.go` files in the same package, Rust's inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, a sibling `*.test.ts` file, a parallel `test/` tree). The test module name in the document should match the module under test; choose a distinct name only if the language enforces one (e.g. a Go external `foo_test` package). A test helper that asserts on payment behavior belongs near the module it tests, not in a generic test module.

The `**Module:**` named for the orchestration must be an orchestration module. Never place the orchestration struct or function in an existing implementation module. If no orchestration module exists for the feature area, create one following the naming pattern of adjacent orchestration modules in the codebase.

Orchestration modules must not contain helper methods that perform or test implementation details. Test helpers — mock factories, HTTP client wiring, fixture builders, assertion utilities — belong in or beside the implementation modules they serve. The orchestration module's test file contains only test functions that exercise orchestration logic; it calls helpers imported from implementation modules, never defines them. If a helper is needed to set up or assert on an implementation concern, it lives with that concern.

Fixture builders for input types (e.g. a struct passed into the orchestration by the caller) belong with the module that owns the type, not the orchestration module. When drafting test helpers, identify every input type in the orchestration signature and place its fixture builder in the module that defines the type.

## File Location

See [Directory Structure](README.md#directory-structure) for where orchestration files are located.

## What Orchestrations Are Not

- **Not a spec.** Orchestrations do not define behavioral guarantees. Put those in a [spec](spec.md).
- **Not a branching tree.** Orchestrations should be exhaustive but designed to minimize paths. If an orchestration has many branches, that is a signal to simplify the design, not to add more cases.
