# Write Orchestration

Create a well-formed orchestration file in `./specs/features/` based on the user's description of the feature or process.

## Steps

1. **Understand the scope.** If the user's request is vague, ask clarifying questions:
   - What process or operation does this orchestration model?
   - Which component and feature does it belong to?
   - What are the main success and failure paths?

2. **Read the orchestration format docs** to refresh your understanding:
   - [docs/specs/orchestration.md](docs/specs/orchestration.md)

3. **Determine the file path.** Check the existing `specs/features/` structure and place the orchestration at `./specs/features/<component>/<feature>/orchestration.md`.

4. **Determine the language** by reading the relevant source files for the feature area.

5. **Check the architecture.** Read `specs/architecture.yaml` and, if it exists, the feature's `specs/features/<component>/<feature>/architecture.yaml` to identify which **implementation modules** should be injected as clients into the orchestration. The orchestration itself must live in a **dedicated orchestration module** — if none exists for this feature area, create one. Do not place the orchestration in an existing implementation module. See [docs/specs/code.md](docs/specs/code.md).

6. **Draft the orchestration and tests** following the format and guidelines in [docs/specs/orchestration.md](docs/specs/orchestration.md). For each input type in the orchestration signature, identify which module owns the type and place its fixture builder there, not in the orchestration module.

7. **Write the file** to `./specs/features/<component>/<feature>/orchestration.md`.

8. **Report** the file path and a one-line summary of what the orchestration models.
